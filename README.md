This repository is a place to discuss & troubleshoot issues with my tutorial on [running Guild Wars 2 on macOS using WINE](https://asmaloney.com/2022/07/howto/running-guild-wars-2-with-dx11-on-macos-using-wine/).

WordPress is not a great medium for back-and-forth forum-like discussion - especially when you need images.

If you have gone through the tutorial and can't get it to work, or you find a problem with it, please [create an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/GW2-macOS/issues) here with as much information as possible (including screenshots).
